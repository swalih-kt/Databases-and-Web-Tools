### 🧬 Databases & Web Tools

This section contains web-based **biological databases and interactive tools** developed to organize and explore variant and gene-level information.

#### 🧩 **Repositories**
- [**speciPFIC**](https://github.com/swalih-kt/speciPFIC) – Database designed for gene-specific pathogenic and functional variant curation.  
- [**ALGVar**](https://github.com/swalih-kt/ALGVar) – Repository for Alzheimer’s and related gene variants with functional insights.  
- [**HLCSdb**](https://github.com/swalih-kt/HLCSdb) – Curated database for Holocarboxylase Synthetase (HLCS) variants and gene annotations.  

#### ⚙️ **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (responsive UI)  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Client-side scripting:** JavaScript (for data handling and dynamic query execution)  

Each database integrates structured variant data with an easy-to-navigate web interface, allowing researchers to query, filter, and visualize clinically relevant genomic information efficiently.
